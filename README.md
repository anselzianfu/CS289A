I self-studied this course in Spring 2018 before joining the RISELab by finishing all assignments. The coding-based part of homework can be found here.

Covered Topics: Regression and classification such as linear models, trees, neural networks, ensemble methods, and instance-based methods; Generative and discriminative probabilistic models; Bayesian parametric learning; Density estimation and clustering; Bayesian networks; Time series models; Dimensionality reduction.
